## HTCAP

Htcap is a web application scanner able to crawl single page application (SPA) in a recursive manner by intercepting ajax calls and DOM changes.  
Htcap is not just another vulnerability scanner since it's focused mainly on the crawling process and uses external tools to discover vulnerabilities. It's designed to be a tool for both manual and automated penetration test of modern web applications.
